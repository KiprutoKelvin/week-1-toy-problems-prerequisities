## Toy Problems Requisite
## Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)- Challenge 1
## Generating student grades in JavaScript using function
## using functin declaratin and returning values while entering the correct parameters
Function prompts the user to input students mark between 0 to 100.
The getStudentGrade() function prompts the user to input a student's mark and then checks whether the input is valid. If the input is not between 0 and 100, the function returns an error message. Otherwise, it checks the mark against each grade boundary and returns the corresponding grades. 

## Speed Detector (Toy Problem)- Challenge 2
speed.js 
The checkSpeed(speed) function which takes the speed of the car as an argument and compares it to the speed limit(70) of 70. If the speed is less than or equal to the speed limit, it prints "Ok". If the speed is greater than the speed limit, it calculates the number of demerit points based on how many km/s over the limit the driver was going. It then checks if the driver has accumulated more than 12 demerit points, in which case it prints "License suspended". If the driver has not accumulated that many demerit points, it prints the number of demerit points they have received so far.
